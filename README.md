# EUI SvelteKit authentication POC

Authentication in SvelteKit with Azure.

## Project setup

Clone repo and duplicate `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the necessary values.

When that's done, run `npm install` in the root of the project to install all the dependencies.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
